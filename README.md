# C#-Advanced Programmming
<p>
The scenario for this project is developing a C# system to manage voting returns from constituencies included in a general
election. Each constituency will submit an XML data file according to a standardised structure
(see later), containing constituency and candidate details together with the number of votes cast
for each of the candidates standing in that constituency. The system will be required to read and
process the XML files for all constituencies across the country in order to determine the election
results. There will be significant numbers of constituency returns in the general election and
speed is the essence in producing the final results, therefore, a multi-threaded system that can
process multiple files concurrently will be required.
</p>
<p>
Ultimately, the intention is for the system to be made available as a client-server application but
this task has been simplified to developing a prototype application that will run on
a standalone PC but making use of separation of concerns so that the job of transferring
the application to the governmentâ€™s client-server environment in the future will be possible with
minimum adjustments to your code.
